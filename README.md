MediCare2018 is a Xamarin cross platform application I am currently working on, as a part of my personal projects. I have also built Restful APIs which provide information like drugs, prescriptions by communicating with SQL database. The goal of the application is to keep track of prescriptions, drugs, send notifications on which drugs to take based on prescriptions. 

Road-map:

Stable bug free application

Host it in Microsoft Azure.

Use open source APIs to provide details on drugs like chemical components, side effects etc

Show analysis on health based on drug intake regularly/irregularly, in the form of graphs

Use image recognition algorithm to identify medicines, medical conditions etc

Use AI, Deep learning and Machine learning to analyze stress, working hours, sleep, climate, medical conditions and foresee sickness and suggest preventive measures
